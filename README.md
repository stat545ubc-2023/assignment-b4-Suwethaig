### About the repository:  
This is an R Markdown document created for Assignment - B4 of the STAT545 course (Part B).  

### The following exercises have been solved as part of the assignment:  
**Exercise 1:** Making a plot of the most common words from a book of your choice after removing the stop words.  

Specifications of the exercise:  
* The Pride & Prejudice book from the *janeaustenr* package was chosen for the exercise.   
* The stop words from the *tidytext* package were then removed from the book.
* The top 10 frequency words were then determined and plotted using a horizontal bar chart.
  
**Exercise 2:** Making a function for a modified version of Pig Latin and documenting it.  

A function was created to convert a word to its Doggified version by following the rules of Dog Latin (modified version of Pig Latin).
Rules of Dog Latin created as part of the exercise:
* If a word starts with a vowel, "ruff" is added to the beginning of it.  
* If a word starts with a consonant or consonant cluster, every letter after the first vowel is rearranged to the beginning of the word, "woff" is added to the beginning of the rearranged word.
